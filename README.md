# Google Form to Google Spreadsheet to Google Doc
<h4> I work at my college on various tech projects. I was tasked with creating a New Software Request Form. </h4>
After creating the Request Form in Google Docs they wanted to make it automated. I started looking into creating a Google Form with the same question from the request form (thinking it would be more user friendly.)
